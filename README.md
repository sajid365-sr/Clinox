## Some Features

`1` The main focus of this project is to implement node, express and mongoDB. On other words it's a simple fullstack website.

`2` I've created all the demo data for services by myself in a json format and post them to the mongoDB database.

`3` JWT system was implemented during email/password based login system for a secure data transfer.

`4` Another important things was to hide sensitive code like firebase config and mongoDB user and 
password also JWT. So I've implement environment variable both client and server side.

`5` This project was created by using React and also used react router. So, you can easily access one page to another within a moment.

`6` I've used Tailwind here as a CSS Library and first time use Flowbite as a CSS plugin.

`7` Also tried to responsive the site as well as.
